"""astc-encoder-py is a  Python binding of [astc-encoder](https://github.com/ARM-software/astc-encoder).

It can compress images into astc textures and decompress astc textures into images.
To yield the best performance, it checks the host CPU and imports the appropriate encoder implementation.
Currently this is only supported on x86_64, all others use an encoder with no SIMD optimizations.
The exception is aarch64, which uses the neon encoder by default.
